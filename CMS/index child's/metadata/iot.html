        IOT or internet of things is a technology that deals with bringing control of physical devices over the internet. Here we propose efficient industry automation system that allows user to efficiently control industry appliances/machines over the internet. For demonstration of this system we use 3 loads as industrial appliances or machines and a motor to demonstrate as an industrial motor. Our system uses an Avr family microcontroller for processing all user commands. A wifi modem is used to connect to the internet and receive user commands. On sending commands through the internet they are first received by our wifi modem. The modem<br />

        decodes information and passes it to the microcontroller for further processing. The microcontroller then switches loads and operates the motors as per receivers commands. Also it displays the system state on an LCD display. Thus we automate entire industry using online GUI for easy industry automation.
